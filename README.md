# Farm Inventory Management System

This project is a **Farm Inventory Management System**, a web application for managing and tracking inventory items. The system allows users to add, delete, and update inventory items, as well as search for specific items. It uses PHP and MySQL for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

## Features

- **Browser:** Modern browser like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Place the files in the web server directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP or `www` for WAMP).

3. Create a MySQL database named `farm_inventory` or use the included code to create it automatically.

4. Update the database credentials in the PHP file if needed:
   ```php
   $servername = "localhost";
   $username = "root";
   $password = "your_password";
   $dbname = "farm_inventory";
   ```

5. Start the web server and MySQL server.

6. Open the application in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost/<project-directory>/
   ```
