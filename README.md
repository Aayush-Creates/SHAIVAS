The Agri Data Portal is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to empower farmers with valuable information and tools to enhance their agricultural practices and improve their livelihoods. This platform integrates data from various sources to provide farmers with insights into weather conditions, market prices, crop ETo (Evapotranspiration), soil descriptions, and crop guidance.

Features

Weather Information:

Users can enter a city name to get real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, and other relevant data.
This information helps farmers plan their activities based on weather conditions.
Market Price Information:

Users can enter a crop name to get the current market prices for that crop.
This information enables farmers to make informed decisions about when and where to sell their produce.
Crop ETo Calculation:

Users can enter the crop type to calculate ETo (Evapotranspiration), which is crucial for efficient irrigation management.
Soil Description:

The platform integrates with data from Shikhar to provide detailed soil descriptions for different locations.
This information helps farmers understand their soil's properties and make informed decisions about fertilizer and irrigation.
Crop Guidance:

The platform utilizes data from Shubh Crop Management to provide farmers with guidance on crop selection, planting schedules, and pest and disease management.
Yield and Loss Prediction:

Based on various factors, including crop type, weather conditions, and soil data, the platform estimates potential crop yields and predicts potential losses due to various factors.
Weather Alerts and Guidance:

The platform provides real-time weather alerts and guidance on how to manage crops during adverse weather conditions.
Harvesting Guidance:

A separate website will be developed to provide farmers with guidance on the optimal time for harvesting different crops based on weather conditions.
